<li><strong>Aug. 14</strong>: Iran's official news agency, IRNA, reports that Iran has been unable to sell 200 million barrels per day (32,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) of crude oil since the imposition of a unilateral oil embargo by the U.S. Iran increasingly has sold its crude oil on spot markets as opposed to long-term contracts. Larger purchases by France, Spain, Italy, China, India, Pakistan, and Thailand have failed to offset decreased demand by German and Japanese refiners. Before the U.S. embargo was announced in April 1995, U.S. companies were buying between 400,000 and 450 million barrels per day (72,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), down from roughly 600 million barrels per day (95,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) in 1994.

<li><strong>November 22</strong>: OPEC states that it will roll over its current oil production quota of 25.42 million barrels per day (4,041,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d). The roll-over was widely anticipated because of slack world oil demand, rising non-OPEC production, and weak prices. (DJ, PON)</li>
<li><strong>November 29</strong>: U.S. President&nbsp;<a title="Bill Clinton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>&nbsp;approves legislation lifting a 22-year-old ban on exports of oil from the Alaskan North Slope (ANS). The ban was imposed after the oil embargo by Arab oil producers in 1973. The lifting of the ban opened up about one-quarter of U.S. crude oil production for export, although no more than 7% of ANS crude was ever exported&nbsp;and exports ceased in 2000. The ANS legislation also waives royalty payments on deep water oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. (WP)</li>
<li><strong>December 12</strong>: Speaking in New York during a U.S. visit by Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos, Joaquim David, president of the state-owned oil company, Sonangol, states that Angola will increase its crude oil production by 10 percent per year over the next five years, reaching 720 million barrels per day (114,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) by the end of 1996 and 1 million barrels per day (160,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) by 2001. The statement comes amidst sporadic violence involving government forces and the rebel group UNITA, less than a year after a peace accord was signed ending the country's 20-year-old civil war. At the end of 1995, Angola had raised its crude oil production to 690 million barrels per day (110,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d). (PON, DJ)</li>

<li><strong>January 17</strong>: Iraq agrees to talks concerning a U.N. plan to allow for the Iraqi sale of $1 billion of oil for 90 days for a 180-day trial period. Under U.N. Resolution 986, proceeds from the sale would be used for humanitarian purposes. In the past, Iraq has opposed clauses 6 and 8b contained in Resolution 986. Clause 6 stipulates that oil exports under this plan must pass through the 1.6&nbsp;Mbbl/d (250,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) Iraq-Turkey pipeline, which currently is unusable because of sludge build-ups and pumping station damage. By most estimates, the line would take a minimum of three months to repair. Clause 8b states that part of the proceeds from the sales would be disbursed under U.N. supervision to Kurdish provinces in northern Iraq. Negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations are scheduled to begin February 6, 1996. (FT, PON, DJ)</li>
<li><strong>January 30</strong>: Vice Admiral Scott Redd, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet based in the Persian Gulf, states that Iran test-fired a new anti-ship missile near the Strait of Hormuz on January 6. The missile reportedly has a range of 60 miles (100&nbsp;km) and is viewed as a threat to regional security by U.S. naval forces operating in the area. Oil tankers carry about 15&nbsp;Mbbl/d (2,400,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) through the Strait. (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>April 24</strong>: In New York, the United Nations and Iraq end a third round of negotiations over Iraq's possible sale of $1 billion of oil for 90 days for a 180-day trial period. Under U.N. Resolution 986, proceeds from the sale would be used for humanitarian purposes. While both sides have reached agreement on most of the key issues, chief Iraqi negotiator Abdul Amir al-Anbari says that the United States and the United Kingdom have fundamentally altered the text of a proposed agreement which he had received from the United Nations early in the third round. Al-Anbari states that the changes have postponed any possible deal. The U.N.-Iraq talks are scheduled to restart on May 10. (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>April 30</strong>: In the United States, President Clinton approves the sale of $227 million of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

<li><strong>May 20</strong>: In New York, the United Nations and Iraq agree to U.N. Resolution 986, which provides Iraq with the opportunity to sell $1 billion of oil for 90 days for a 180-day trial period. Under the resolution, proceeds from the sale would be used for humanitarian purposes. The agreement comes following months of heated negotiations. Iraqi oil exports are expected to begin by the Fall of 1996, after a pumping station on the Iraq-Turkey pipeline is repaired and U.N monitoring and aid distribution facilities are put in place. Shortly after the agreement, the White House announces its decision to allow U.S. oil companies to purchase Iraqi oil exports. (FT, PON, WSJ)</li>
<li><strong>June 11</strong>:&nbsp;<a title="Exxon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon">Exxon</a>&nbsp;states that it will soon begin work on its $15-billion Sakhalin I oil and natural gas development in Russia's Far East.

The $300 million appraisal program will include drilling one exploration well and conducting a 3-D seismic survey. The U.S. company says that it will start working despite ongoing differences with the Russian government over the country's new production sharing law, which is widely viewed as not offering adequate legal protection for foreign investment in the country's oil and gas sectors. (FT)</li>
<li><strong>June 20</strong>: The Venezuelan Congress approves eight, multibillion-dollar, profit-sharing deals which allow foreign oil companies to explore and produce oil in Venezuela for the first time since the country's 1975 nationalization of the oil industry. The deals could boost Venezuela's current oil production by 500,000&nbsp;bbl/d (79,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) by 2005. Foreign oil companies such as Amoco and British Petroleum are expected to sign final deals with state-owned PdVSA within 10 days and may begin working on their new land by the third quarter of 1996. The eight blocks are estimated to hold between 7 and 11 billion barrels (1.7&times;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) of light crude oil reserves. (PON, DJ)</li>

Under the law, the President would be required to impose at least two of the following sanctions: import and export bans; lending embargoes from U.S. banks; a ban on U.S. procurement of goods and services from sanctioned companies; and a denial of U.S export financing. The European Union stated its opposition to the U.S. law and threatened retaliation. (FT)</li>
<li><strong>August 21</strong>: In Venezuela, a subsidiary of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA), Corpoven, signs a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with U.S.-based ARCO. The MOU provides for a $3.5-billion joint venture to develop and upgrade roughly 200,000&nbsp;bbl/d (32,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) of crude oil from the country's 270-billion Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt. The project will produce 9&deg; API gravity crude oil in the Hamaca region and upgrade it to 25&deg; API for export to U.S. refineries. The project will be implemented in three phases, the last of which will be completed in 2006. Another PdVSA subsidiary, Maraven, recently signed another, similar deal with Conoco. (PON, FT)</li>
<li><strong>September 5</strong>: Following U.S. cruise missile strikes on military facilities in southern Iraq, crude oil prices rise as the market speculates when Iraq will begin exporting oil under U.N. Resolution 986. Benchmark Brent Blend for October rises above $22/barrel amidst the uncertainty. The U.S. attack follows an Iraqi-supported invasion of Kurdish safe haven areas in the country's northern area. Subsequently, President Bill Clinton states that the U.N. oil-for-food sale should be postponed indefinitely. (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>October 30</strong>: Exxon confirms that it is in talks with state-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corporation concerning the application of new technology to convert natural gas to petroleum products. Exxon believes that technology developed in a successful 200&nbsp;bbl/d (32&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) Anatural gas refinery project in Texas would work in Qatar, where a proposed $1-billion plant would be able produce between 50,000&nbsp;bbl/d (7,900&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) and 100,000&nbsp;bbl/d (16,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) of middle distillate products. Under the proposal, Qatar's 270&nbsp;trillion cubic feet (7,600&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>) North field would supply between 0.5&times;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (14,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) and 1&times;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (28,000,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) per day of gas for use as feedstock. In the past, technological barriers and high costs have precluded the development of natural gas refineries. (WSJ)</li>
<li><strong>December 18</strong>: During a press conference, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Maleki states that Iran supports the free flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, but reserves the option of closing off the shipping route if it is threatened.

At present, exports of 26.37 million barrels (4,192,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) have been approved for the second 90-day period of the sale, which allows Iraq to sell up to $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days for an initial 6-month period. In mid-December 1996, Iraq restarted the Kirkuk&ndash;Ceyhan pipeline, which is expected to carry up to 450,000&nbsp;bbl/d (72,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) of oil under the sales agreements approved so far under U.N.

<li><strong>August 8</strong>: The United Nations approves a sale-price formula for Iraqi crude oil sales under the oil-for-food plan. The approval cleared the way for Iraq to resume limited oil exports immediately through the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea and Iraq's Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr. The United Nations will also begin reviewing contracts for Iraqi crude oil purchases. Iraq has until September 5 to raise the $1.07 billion allowed under the existing 90 day oil-for-food plan window. Iraqi officials state they will boost exports to 2 million barrels per day (320,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) to meet the sales target. However, industry experts say that Iraq's export capacity is untested beyond 1.4-million-barrels-per-day (220,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d). (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>September 12</strong>: The United Nations Security Council passes a resolution that allows Iraq to reach the $2.14 billion oil sales limit under its oil-for-food program by December 5. The current 6-month oil sales window, running from June 8 to December 5, will be split into a 120-day segment and a 60-day segment instead of two 90-day segments. During each segment Iraq can sell $1.07 billion worth of oil. The resolution should enable Iraq to make up for lost revenues during a delay in the start of oil sales during the first two months of the current six-month sale period. (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>October 29</strong>: Iraq's Revolution Command Council, the country's main decision making body, announces that it will no longer allow U.S. citizens and U.S. aircraft to serve with the United Nations (U.N.) arms inspection teams. The council's statement gives U.S. citizens working with the inspection teams one week to leave Iraq. Iraq has also asked the U.N. to stop flights by American reconnaissance aircraft monitoring its compliance with U.N. resolutions requiring the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. In response to this statement, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approves a statement condemning Iraq's threats to expel the Americans. (DJ)</li>
<li><strong>November 20</strong>: Iraq's Revolution Command Council formally endorses an agreement, arranged by Russia, that enables United Nation's (U.N.) weapons inspection teams to resume operations in Iraq. The deal ends a three-week standoff between the U.N. and Iraq that began in late October 1997 after Iraq announced it would no longer allow U.S. citizens to serve on U.N. weapons' inspection teams.

<li><strong>November 29</strong>: For the first time in four years, OPEC agrees to an increase in its production ceiling. OPEC has raised the ceiling to 27.5 million barrels per day (4,370,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) for the first half of 1998, effective January 1, 1998. The new ceiling represents a 10 percent increase over the current ceiling. The new quotas are as follows: Saudi Arabia 8.76 million barrels per day (1,393,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d) (bbl/d), Iran 3.942&nbsp;Mbbl/d (626,700&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Iraq 1.314&nbsp;Mbbl/d (208,900&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Venezuela 2.583&nbsp;Mbbl/d (410,700&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Nigeria 2.042&nbsp;Mbbl/d (324,700&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Indonesia 1.456&nbsp;Mbbl/d (231,500&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Kuwait 2.19&nbsp;Mbbl/d (348,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Libya 1.522&nbsp;Mbbl/d (242,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), United Arab Emirates 2.366&nbsp;Mbbl/d (376,200&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), Algeria 0.909&nbsp;Mbbl/d (144,500&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d), and Qatar 0.414&nbsp;Mbbl/d (65,800&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/d).

<li><strong>December 4</strong>: Iraq's United Nations (U.N.) Ambassador&nbsp;<a title="Nizar Hamdoon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizar_Hamdoon">Nizar Hamdoon</a>&nbsp;warns that Iraq will not allow oil to flow during a third six-month phase of the U.N.'s oil-for-food sale until the U.N. approves an aid distribution plan. Despite the warning, the U.N. Security Council approves a third six-month phase following the end of the second six-month phase. Like the first two phases, the third phase allows Iraq to sell up to $1.07 billion of oil in each of two 90-day periods. However, the sales level may be increased by the Security Council in January 1998 after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reports on Iraq's needs. The next day Iraq stops pumping oil into the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline at the end of the second six-month phase of the United Nations (U.N.) oil-for-food program. (WP, NYT)</li>
<li><strong>December 11</strong>: Delegates from 150 industrial nations attending a United Nations climate conference in Kyoto, Japan reach agreement on a protocol to control heat-trapping greenhouse gases. The protocol, if ratified, would commit nations to roll back emissions of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) below 1990 levels. Under the protocol, the United States would be required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels, while Europe and Japan would make cuts of 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Developing countries are exempt from the emissions ceilings for the time being. (DJ)</li>
